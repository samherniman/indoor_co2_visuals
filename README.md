## Buildings

This month there were 1158 measurements of 862 unique buildings. The
most measured building was Caritas-Krankenhaus Sankt Josef, a hospital
in Regensburg, Deutschland (min: 505, mean: 778, max: 1086), which was
measured 15 times.

The building with the highest measured CO<sup>2</sup> levels was
Bibliothèque Arts et multimédia in Seine-Saint-Denis, France with a
median CO<sup>2</sup> value of 2601 ppm. The buildings with the lowest
measured CO<sup>2</sup> levels were Big Fernand in Brest, France and
Hôtel Le Vauban in Brest, France with median CO<sup>2</sup> values of
423 ppm. There were some measurements that were even lower than this,
but we have removed them from this analysis. Generally outdoor
CO<sup>2</sup> levels don’t go below 410 ppm, therefore we have removed
any datapoints that are below 400 ppm. If your CO<sup>2</sup> monitor
consistently shows levels below 410 ppm while you are inside or outside,
it is likely that your monitor needs recalibrating.

Here is a graph of all the recordings that happened this month shown by
the grey curves. I’ve highlighted the highest and lowest ones.
