	abstract = {Air pollution is an under-recognised global health threat linked to an increased risk of cancers and is due primarily to the burning of fossil fuels. This review provides a high-level overview of the associations between outdoor and indoor air pollution and cancer risk and outcomes.Outdoor air pollutants are largely due to the burning of fossil fuels from human activities, although there is growing data implicating outdoor pollution from wildfire smoke. Indoor air pollution is primarily caused by burning solid fuel sources such as wood, coal and charcoal for household cooking and heating. There is a growing number of pieces of evidence linking exposure to pollution and the risk of developing cancers. The strongest evidence is seen on the positive association of air pollution, particularly particulate matter 2.5 with lung cancer. Emerging data implicate exposure to pollutants in the development of breast, gastrointestinal and other cancers. The mechanisms underlying these associations include oxidative stress, inflammation and direct {DNA} damage facilitated by pollutant absorption and distribution in the body.References were identified through a {PubMed} search for articles published in 2000 to October 2024 using the terms ‘air pollution’ or ‘pollutants’ and ‘carcinoma’ or ‘'cancer’.Air pollution poses significant risks to health. Its health impacts, including cancer risks, are often underestimated. Hazardous pollutants have been studied in several epidemiological cohort studies. Despite the mounting evidence, air pollution is often overlooked in predictive cancer risk models and public health intervention.},

	abstract = {Background: Ambient air pollution has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) in the elderly. However, its effects on {AD} have not been meta-analyzed comprehensively.
Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the associations between air pollution and {AD} incidence.
Methods: We searched {PubMed} and Web of Science for indexed publications up to March 2020. Odds risk ({OR}) and confidence intervals ({CI}) were estimated for particulate matter ({PM})10 ({PM}10), {PM}2.5, ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide ({NO}2), sulfur dioxide ({SO}2), and carbon monoxide ({CO}). The subgroup analysis was conducted based on the pollution levels.
Results: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis and review. The {OR} per 10μg/m3 increase of {PM}2.5 was 1.95 (95\% {CI}: 0.88–4.30). The corresponding values per 10μg/m3 increment of other pollutants were 1.03 (95\% {CI}: 0.68–1.57) for O3, 1.00 (95\% {CI}: 0.89–1.13) for {NO}2, and 0.95 (95\% {CI}: 0.91–0.99) for {PM}10 (only one study), respectively. Overall {OR} of the five air pollutants above with {AD} was 1.32 (95\% {CI}: 1.09–1.61), suggesting a positive association between ambient air pollution and {AD} incidence. The sub-analysis indicated that the {OR} (2.20) in heavily polluted regions was notably higher than that in lightly polluted regions (1.06). Although {AD} risk rate data related to {SO}2 or {CO} exposure are still limited, the epidemiologic and toxicological evidence indicated that higher concentration of {SO}2 or {CO} exposure increased risks of dementia, implying that {SO}2 or {CO} might have a potential impact on {AD}.
Conclusion: Air pollution exposure may exacerbate {AD} development.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Accumulating evidence links fine particulate matter ({PM}2·5) to premature mortality, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. However, less is known about the influence of {PM}2·5 on neurological disorders. We aimed to investigate the effect of long-term {PM}2·5 exposure on development of Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.
{METHODS}: We did a longitudinal cohort study in which we constructed a population-based nationwide open cohort including all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries (aged ≥65 years) in the contiguous United States (2000-16) with no exclusions. We assigned {PM}2·5 postal code (ie, {ZIP} code) concentrations based on mean annual predictions from a high-resolution model. To accommodate our very large dataset, we applied Cox-equivalent Poisson models with parallel computing to estimate hazard ratios ({HRs}) for first hospital admission for Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, adjusting for potential confounders in the health models.
{FINDINGS}: Between Jan 1, 2000, and Dec 31, 2016, of 63 038 019 individuals who were aged 65 years or older during the study period, we identified 1·0 million cases of Parkinson's disease and 3·4 million cases of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias based on primary and secondary diagnosis billing codes. For each 5 μg/m3 increase in annual {PM}2·5 concentrations, the {HR} was 1·13 (95\% {CI} 1·12-1·14) for first hospital admission for Parkinson's disease and 1·13 (1·12-1·14) for first hospital admission for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. For both outcomes, there was strong evidence of linearity at {PM}2·5 concentrations less than 16 μg/m3 (95th percentile of the {PM}2·5 distribution), followed by a plateaued association with increasingly larger confidence bands.
{INTERPRETATION}: We provide evidence that exposure to annual mean {PM}2·5 in the {USA} is significantly associated with an increased hazard of first hospital admission with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. For the ageing American population, improving air quality to reduce {PM}2·5 concentrations to less than current national standards could yield substantial health benefits by reducing the burden of neurological disorders.

	abstract = {Air pollution, a growing concern for public health, has been linked to various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Emerging evidence also suggests a link between exposure to air pollutants and neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}). This review explores the composition and sources of air pollutants, including particulate matter, gases, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy metals. The pathophysiology of {AD} is briefly discussed, highlighting the role of beta-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and genetic factors. This article also examines how air pollutants reach the brain and exert their detrimental effects, delving into the neurotoxicity of air pollutants. The molecular mechanisms linking air pollution to neurodegeneration are explored in detail, focusing on oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and protein aggregation. Preclinical studies, including in vitro experiments and animal models, provide evidence for the direct effects of pollutants on neuronal cells, glial cells, and the blood–brain barrier. Epidemiological studies have reported associations between exposure to air pollution and an increased risk of {AD} and cognitive decline. The growing body of evidence supporting air pollution as a modifiable risk factor for {AD} underscores the importance of considering environmental factors in the etiology and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, in the face of worsening global air quality.},

	abstract = {Rationale: Outdoor air pollution causes emergency department visits and hospitalizations for childhood asthma. In the United States, the Air Quality Index ({AQI}) alerts the public to air quality and provides behavioral recommendations to reduce exposure and harm, yet little is known about the relationship between the {AQI} and childhood asthma exacerbations.

Objectives: To test for association between the {AQI} and childhood asthma exacerbations resulting in emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

Methods: This was a retrospective time-stratified case-crossover study, conducted using medical records data from 2010 through 2018 for children aged 6–17 years with a primary diagnosis of an asthma exacerbation (defined as an emergency department visit or hospitalization for asthma) at {UPMC} Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. Daily {AQI} data was obtained for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania from the Environmental Protection Agency. Conditional logistic regression was used for analyses of the {AQI} (as both a continuous and categorical variable) and asthma exacerbations. Stratified analyses were conducted to explore modification of the {AQI} effects on asthma exacerbations by race and other covariates.

Results: There were 6,573 events. Particulate matter {\textless}2.5 μm ({PM}2.5) was the primary pollutant responsible for the {AQI}, followed by ozone (62\% and 29\% of days with events, respectively). The overall {AQI} was associated with asthma exacerbations (e.g., as continuous, per 10-unit increase, Lag Day 2: odds ratio [{OR}], 1.014; 95\% confidence interval [{CI}], 1.003–1.025; Lag Day 3: {OR}, 1.012; 95\% {CI}, 1.001–1.023). By pollutant-specific {AQI}, the association was strongest for {PM}2.5. In stratified analyses, the {AQI} was associated with exacerbations in Black and younger children (6–11 yr) on Lag Day 4.

Conclusions: The {AQI} is associated with asthma exacerbations among children in Allegheny County. This is driven primarily by {PM}2.5, with Black and younger children particularly affected. Healthcare providers should discuss the {AQI} in asthma management.},

	abstract = {Background
Daily air quality index ({AQI}) forecast can provide early warning information, and it is not clear whether it is appropriate for childhood asthma hospitalizations ({CAHs}). Furthermore, little is known about the effects of {AQI} on {CAHs}, as well as the interactions between temperature, humidity and {AQI}.
Methods
We collected 32,238 cases in Hefei from 2013 to 2016 and estimated the association between daily {CAHs} and {AQI} by combining the Poisson Generalized Linear Models ({PGLMs}) with the Distributed Lag Nonlinear Models ({DLNMs}). The interaction between {AQI} and temperature was tested by stratifying {AQI} and temperature, as well as humidity.
Results
{AQI} was associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations for childhood asthma. The adverse effect first appeared on the 3rd day, with the {RR} of 1.011 (95\%{CI}: 1.000–1.023) and continued until the 19th day of lag ({RR} = 1.010, 95\%{CI}: 1.001–1.020). In the subgroup analysis, the male and pre-school children were more sensitive to {AQI}, and there are seasonal differences in the effects of {AQI} on {CAHs}. Besides, in a stratified analysis with an {AQI} of 150, we found synergies between temperature, humidity and {AQI}. The interaction relative risk ({IRR}) and relative excess risk due to interaction ({RERI}) for the interaction between temperature and {AQI} were 1.157 (95\%{CI}: 1.029–1.306) and 0.122 (95\%{CI}: 0.022–0.223) respectively. For the humidity, the {IRR} and {RERI} were 1.090 (95\%{CI}: 1.056–1.206) and 0.083 (95\%{CI}: 0.083–0.143) respectively. Exploring different subgroups in the interaction analyses, it was worth noting that female and pre-school children were more sensitive to the interaction between {AQI} and temperature, while school-age children were more sensitive to the interaction between {AQI} and humidity.
Conclusions
The study found that not only {AQI} can significantly increase the risk of {CAHs}, but also that under the context of climate change, temperature and humidity have a synergistic effect on {AQI}, suggesting that considering only the warning information of air pollution is not enough to strengthen the prevention of childhood asthma hospitalization.},

While there is a large literature linking ambient air pollution and asthma morbidity, less is known about the impact of indoor air pollution on asthma. Concentrating on the indoor environments is particularly important for children, since they can spend as much as 90\% of their time indoors. This review focuses on studies conducted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Childhood Asthma in the Urban Environment as well as other relevant epidemiologic studies. Analysis of exposure outcome relationships in the published literature demonstrates the importance of evaluating indoor home environmental air pollution sources as risk factors for asthma morbidity. Important indoor air pollution determinants of asthma morbidity in urban environments include particulate matter (particularly the coarse fraction), nitrogen dioxide, and airborne mouse allergen exposure. Avoidance of harmful environmental exposures is a key component of national and international guideline recommendations for management of asthma. This literature suggests that modifying the indoor environment to reduce particulate matter, {NO}2, and mouse allergen may be an important asthma management strategy. More research documenting effectiveness of interventions to reduce those exposures and improve asthma outcomes is needed.},

To compare the potential effect of home air pollutants on asthma in urban and rural houses, two case–control populations, composed of children living in the city (32 asthmatics and 31 controls) and in the countryside (24 asthmatics and 27 controls) were included. During 1 week, nitrogen dioxide, fine particles, and volatile organic compounds (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) were assessed at home. Urban dwellings were found to be more polluted than rural ones, with concentrations up to two times higher. In the whole population, exposure to acetaldehyde and toluene was significantly associated with a higher risk of asthma. In the urban population, the association with toluene was significant in children studied during winter, and with toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene when cases were restricted to current asthmatics. In rural settings, a relationship between asthma and formaldehyde exposure was observed ({OR} = 10.7; 95\% {CI} 1.69–67.61). Our findings suggest that daily continuous exposures to pollutants may be implicated in asthma, even in the case of low exposure, as those found in rural areas. Our results could also indicate a specific effect of indoor pollution in the rural environment. Practical Implications Everyday exposure to indoor pollution was associated with a higher risk of childhood asthma. These findings suggest that even at low concentrations, pollutants could be implicated in asthma and reinforce the importance of establishing guideline values to improve indoor air quality by limiting sources or by optimizing ventilation. Specific effects could occur in rural environments where pollution differs from urban area.},

Higher indoor pollution is anticipated due to increasingly energy-efficient and less leaky buildings together with more indoor activities. Studies of indoor air pollution focusing on children and people with respiratory disease from the database Web of Science (1991–2021) were systemically reviewed according to the {PRISMA} guidelines, with 69 studies included in the final selection. Emissions from building materials affected indoor air quality, and ventilation also had an influence. The main indoor air pollutants are Volatile Organic Compounds ({VOCs}) and Particulate Matter ({PM}). {PM} sources included smoking, cooking, heating, candles, and insecticides, whereas sources of coarse particles were pets, housework and human movements. {VOC} sources included household products, cleaning agents, glue, personal care products, building materials and vehicle emissions. Formaldehyde levels were particularly high in new houses. Personal exposure related to both indoor and outdoor pollutant levels, highlighting home characteristics and air exchange rates as important factors. Temperature, humidity, educational level, air purifiers and time near sources were also related to personal exposure. There was an association between {PM} and Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide ({FeNO}), lung function, oxygen saturation, childhood asthma and symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) patients. High {VOCs} were associated with upper airways and asthma symptoms and cancer. Effective interventional studies for {PM} in the future might focus on human behavior together with air purifiers and increased ventilation, whereas {VOC} interventions might center more on building materials and household products, alongside purification and ventilation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Over half the world’s population, mostly from developing countries, use solid fuel for domestic purposes and are exposed to very high concentrations of harmful air pollutants with potential health effects such as respiratory problems, cardiovascular problems, infant mortality and ocular problems. The evidence also suggests that, although the total percentage of people using solid fuel is decreasing, the absolute number is currently increasing. Exposure to smoke from solid fuel burning increases the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}) and lung cancer in adults, and acute lower respiratory tract infection/pneumonia in children. Despite the heterogeneity among studies, the association between {COPD} and exposure to smoke produced by burning different types of solid fuel is consistent. However, there is strong evidence that while coal burning is a risk factor for lung cancer, exposure to other biomass fuel smoke is less so. There is some evidence that reduction of smoke exposure using improved cooking stoves reduces the risk of {COPD} and, possibly, acute lower respiratory infection in children, so approaches to reduce biomass smoke exposure are likely to result in reductions in the global burden of respiratory disease.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Outdoor and indoor air pollution poses a significant cardiovascular risk, and has been associated with atherosclerosis, the main underlying pathology in many cardiovascular diseases. Although, it is well known that exposure to air pollution causes pulmonary disease, recent studies have shown that cardiovascular health consequences of air pollution generally equal or exceed those due to pulmonary diseases. The objective of this article is to evaluate the current evidence on the emerging role of environmental air pollutions in cardiovascular disease, with specific focus on the types of air pollutants and mechanisms of air pollution-induced cardiotoxicity. Published literature on pollution was systematically reviewed and cited in this article. It is hoped that this review will provide a better understanding of the harmful cardiovascular effects induced by air pollution exposure. This will help to bring a better understanding on the possible preventive health measures and will also serve regulatory agencies and researchers. In addition, elucidating the biological mechanisms underlying the link between air pollution and cardiovascular disease is an essential target in developing novel pharmacological strategies aimed at decreasing adverse effects of air pollution on cardiovascular system.},
